Jelastic DB node SSH tunneling

SSH tunnelling is a method of transporting arbitrary networking data over an encrypted SSH connection. It can be used to add encryption to legacy applications. It can also be used to implement VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) and access intranet services across firewalls.

SSH tunnelling allows you to create a local database server connection with the help of a remote SSH session (e.g. from your desktop). Use this add-on together with a compatible desktop admin GUI to avoid the risks of exposing your database server directly to the internet via public IP.
